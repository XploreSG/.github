The ExploreSG platform is more than just an application; it's a scalable, resilient, and secure ecosystem. To achieve this, we built our organization on an industrial-grade foundation that prioritizes stability and clear ownership.

We adopted a polyrepo strategy, treating each microservice as an independent, testable, and replaceable component. This separation isn't just for tidiness—it's a deliberate design choice that isolates failure domains and simplifies security auditing.

All of this is anchored by our meta-repository (exploresg). This is the single source of truth for our entire infrastructure, housing the Terraform code and GitOps manifests that define our production environment. This structure gives us push-button infrastructure, repeatable deployments, and the power to roll back changes with surgical precision
